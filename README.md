# ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Classification - Mini Project

ðŸ‘‹ Hello folks! Welcome to this exciting mini-project on **Breast Cancer Classification**!

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The main objective is to build and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models to identify the most accurate classifier for breast cancer diagnosis. The models evaluated include:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

We assess the performance of each model using the following metrics:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Confusion Matrix  

By comparing these metrics, we aim to select the best-performing model for breast cancer classification and provide insights into its effectiveness in medical diagnosis.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries

The project is built on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using **Python** and popular libraries such as:

- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

Hope you enjoy the journey! ðŸš—ðŸ“Šâœ¨
